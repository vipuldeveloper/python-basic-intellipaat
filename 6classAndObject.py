#object: as defined and create from classes(blueprint)
    #     Basic unit of oops
    #     object is instance of class
    #     can be more than more instance of class
    #     Each object holds own relevant data
    #     Objects with similar properties and methods are grouped together to form a class

#class: blueprint of object 
    # attributes = variables
    # behaviour =  methods/function    

class className:
    variable = "value"
    def fun():
        pass
    

#call function
obj = className()

#IMP: special or magic method: __init__ Called as constructor method, call immediate once created object
